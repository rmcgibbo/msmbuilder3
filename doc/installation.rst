Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

MSMBuilder3 requires a functioning scientific python distribution, including the ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``pandas``, ``matplotlib``, ``tables`` and ``ipython`` packages. You'll need to install ``MDTraj``, a package for manipulating molecular dynamics trajectories. See `Installing the Scipy Stack <http://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_ and `Getting Started with MDTraj <http://mdtraj.s3.amazonaws.com/getting_started.html>`_ for details.

Once you have the dependencies, you can install msmbuilder3 using ``python setup.py install`` to add the ``msmb`` script to your ``PATH``, or you can run the ``msmb`` script directly in the source directory.
